## üìñ Overview

**LinkedIn Posts Hunter MCP** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for automating LinkedIn job post search and management through your AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP-compatible clients).

### How it works:

**1. Authentication & Scraping**
- The MCP server exposes a Playwright-based tool that your AI assistant can invoke to automate browser interactions with LinkedIn
- First-time use requires logging into LinkedIn through a browser window to capture session cookies
- These cookies are **stored locally on your computer** for persistent authentication
- Once authenticated, your AI assistant can call the search tool with keywords (either from your conversation or suggested by the AI) to scrape job posts

**2. Local Data Storage**
- All scraped posts are saved to a **local SQLite database** on your machine
- The database stores post content, metadata (author, dates, engagement metrics), and tracking info (whether you've applied)
- Your data never leaves your computer

**3. Visual Interface**
- A separate tool launches a **React dashboard** that renders the scraped posts from your local database
- The UI provides table/card views, advanced filtering, and quick actions (mark as applied,save, edit, delete, etc.)
- Changes made in the React app are written to the local database

**4. Dual Control**
- You can manage posts through **either** the React UI **or** through MCP tools like `linkedin_manage_posts` and `linkedin_set_filters`
- The React app updates via **polling**, so changes made through MCP commands are reflected in the UI
- This gives you flexibility: use natural language commands with your AI assistant, or point-and-click in the dashboard

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A LinkedIn account
- **Cursor IDE** (for mcp.json method) or **Claude Desktop** (for .mcpb method)

### Method 1: Using the Pre-built .mcpb Package

The easiest way to install is using the pre-built MCP bundle:

1. **Download or clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp.git
   cd linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```
   This installs dependencies for both the main server and the React client.

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Create the .mcpb package:**
   ```bash
   npm run pack
   ```
   This generates `linkedin-playwright-mcp.mcpb` in the project root.

5. **Install the package in Claude Desktop:**
   - Double-click the `.mcpb` file, or
   - Drag it onto the Claude Desktop app, or
   - Use the Claude Desktop settings to add the package manually

### Method 2: Using mcp.json in Cursor IDE

For development or if you're using Cursor IDE:

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp.git
   cd linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp
   npm run install:all
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Locate or create your MCP configuration file:**
   
   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/
     code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/mcp.json
     ```
   
   - **On Windows:**
     ```powershell
     mkdir -Force "$env:APPDATA\Cursor\User\globalStorage"
     notepad "$env:APPDATA\Cursor\User\globalStorage\mcp.json"
     ```

3. **Add the server configuration to `mcp.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "F:/projects/linkedin/linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp/build/index.js"
         ],
         "cwd": "F:/projects/linkedin/linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Replace `F:/projects/linkedin/linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp` with your actual project path.

4. **Restart Cursor** to load the MCP server.

## üéØ What You Can Do

### Job Search Workflow Example

1. **Authenticate with LinkedIn:**
   ```
   User: "Authenticate my LinkedIn account"
   AI: Opens a browser for you to log in, saves credentials
   ```

2. **Search for opportunities:**
   ```
   User: "Search LinkedIn for 'Senior TypeScript Developer remote' jobs"
   AI: Searches LinkedIn, extracts post details, saves to database
   ```

3. **Review results:**
   ```
   User: "Show me the last 10 posts I found"
   AI: Displays posts with links, descriptions, and metadata
   ```

4. **Visual exploration:**
   ```
   User: "Open the post viewer"
   AI: Launches React dashboard at http://localhost:5174
   ```

5. **Track applications:**
   ```
   User: "Mark posts 5, 7, and 12 as applied"
   AI: Updates the database and confirms
   ```

6. **Filter and manage:**
   ```
   User: "Show only posts from this month that I haven't applied to yet"
   AI: Filters and displays matching posts
   ```

### Additional Use Cases

- **Bulk operations**: "Delete all posts older than 3 months"
- **Analytics**: "How many posts did I save this week?"
- **Smart filtering**: "Show posts with 'React' or 'Vue' that have over 50 likes"
- **Export ready**: Database is SQLite, easily query with SQL tools

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

Posts are stored in a SQLite database (`linkedin.db`) with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  search_keywords TEXT NOT NULL,
  post_link TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  search_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  applied INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  profile_image TEXT DEFAULT '',
  author_name TEXT DEFAULT '',
  author_occupation TEXT DEFAULT '',
  post_date TEXT DEFAULT '',
  like_count TEXT DEFAULT '',
  comment_count TEXT DEFAULT ''
);
```

Indexes are created on `post_link`, `search_date`, and `applied` for fast queries.

## üé® React Dashboard Features

The built-in web viewer (`start_vite_viewer`) provides:

- **üìä Table View**: Sortable columns with all post metadata
- **üé¥ Card View**: Visual cards with profile images and engagement metrics
- **üîç Advanced Filtering**: By keyword, date range, applied status, and IDs
- **‚úÖ Quick Actions**: Mark posts as applied directly from the UI
- **üîÑ Real-time Updates**: Filter state syncs between UI and MCP commands
- **üíÖ Modern Design**: Built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Vite

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Credentials**: LinkedIn cookies are stored locally in your system's user data directory
- **No cloud sync**: All data stays on your machine
- **Playwright**: Uses a real browser for authentication (more secure than API scraping)
- **Read-only by default**: Only writes to the database when you explicitly save posts

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Tool not found" error
- Make sure you've restarted Cursor/Claude Desktop after installation
- Verify the MCP server is listed in the available servers

### Authentication fails
- LinkedIn may require 2FA - complete it in the browser window
- Try `force_reauth: true` to start fresh

### Browser doesn't open
- Check that Playwright browsers are installed: `npx playwright install`

### Client won't build
- Ensure client dependencies are installed: `cd src/client-vite && npm install`

### Database errors with .mcpb (Node.js version mismatch)
- **Fixed in v1.0.0+**: Now uses sql.js (pure JavaScript) instead of better-sqlite3
- No native module compilation needed - works across all Node.js versions
- If you installed an older version, reinstall the latest .mcpb package
