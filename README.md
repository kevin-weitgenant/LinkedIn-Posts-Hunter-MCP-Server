## üìñ Overview

**LinkedIn Posts Hunter MCP** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for automating LinkedIn job post search and management through your AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP-compatible clients).

**Why LinkedIn Posts?** Job opportunities often appear in LinkedIn posts first, before they're posted on traditional job boards. By monitoring LinkedIn posts, you can discover opportunities earlier and get a competitive advantage in your job search.

### How it works:

**1. Authentication & Scraping**
- The MCP server exposes a Playwright-based tool that your AI assistant can invoke to automate browser interactions with LinkedIn
- First-time use requires logging into LinkedIn through a browser window to capture session cookies
- These cookies are **stored locally on your computer** for persistent authentication
- Once authenticated, your AI assistant can call the search tool with keywords (either from your conversation or suggested by the AI) to scrape job posts

**2. Local Data Storage**
- All scraped posts are saved to a **local SQLite database** on your machine
- The database stores post content, metadata (author, dates, engagement metrics), and tracking info (whether you've applied)
- Your data never leaves your computer

**3. Visual Interface**
- A separate tool launches a **React dashboard** that renders the scraped posts from your local database
- **Visualize all your scraped posts** in table or card views with profile images and engagement metrics
- **Track your applications** by marking posts as "applied" or "saved for later" directly in the UI
- **Quick actions** let you filter, sort, and manage posts with point-and-click simplicity
- Changes made in the React app are written to the local database. And changes made through MCP commands are reflected in the UI.

**4. Dual Control**
- You can manage posts through **either** the React UI **or** through MCP tools like `manage_posts` and `viewer_filters`
- The React app updates via **polling**, so changes made through MCP commands are reflected in the UI
- This gives you flexibility: use natural language commands with your AI assistant, or point-and-click in the dashboard

---

### Method 1: Download Pre-built .mcpb Package (Claude Desktop Only) üéÅ

**Works for:** Claude Desktop only

**üí° Easiest method!** This is the simplest installation option - just one click! However, the `.mcpb` format is still relatively new and not yet widely adopted by the MCP community.

1. **Download the latest `.mcpb` file** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kevin-weitgenant/LinkedIn-Posts-Hunter-MCP-Server/releases)

2. **Install with one click:**
   - Double-click the `.mcpb` file, or
   - Drag it onto the Claude Desktop app

3. **Done!** Claude Desktop automatically configures everything for you.

---

### Method 2: Using mcp.json Configuration (Recommended) ‚≠ê

**Works for:** Cursor IDE and Claude Desktop

This is the most reliable and widely-supported installation method.

1. **Install globally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp
   ```

   **What you'll see:**
   - Package download progress with visible feedback
   - Dependency installation (~234 packages)
   - Playwright Chromium browser download (~300MB)
   - Installation typically completes in 1-3 minutes
   
   ‚úÖ You'll know exactly when the installation is complete!

2. **Add to your MCP configuration:**

   **For Cursor IDE:**
   
   Open or create `mcp.json` at:
   - **macOS/Linux:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` (typically `C:\Users\YourName\.cursor\mcp.json`)
   
   Add this configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp": {
         "command": "linkedin-posts-hunter-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **For Claude Desktop:**
